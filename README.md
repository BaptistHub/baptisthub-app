# Welcome to the baptist hub app
## What is Baptist hub?
Baptist Hub is a dedicated streaming platform designed to host sermons from respected Independent Fundamentalist Baptist (IFB) preachers. We are currently developing iOS, Android, and web applications using React Native with the Expo framework to provide a seamless experience across devices. Officially launched on October 26, 2024, Baptist Hub aims to be a carefully curated repository for biblically sound content and impactful preaching.

## Current status
At present, the app features audio content exclusively from Love Baptist, Cornerstone baptist, Mountain baptist, and First Works churches. We plan to expand our offerings by including additional churches in the future. Currently, the app streams sermons in audio format, with video streaming capabilities to be introduced soon. Platform support is currently limited to Android devices; please visit the APK download section to install the app on your device.
